# Adjectives
## What?
Give a noun additional info that it needs. This depends on the noun *and* the verb and is usually mandatory. They start with `,` and can contain anything. Adjectives are **single-use only**, they will only be applicable to the noun that follows them and will immediately be dropped after that noun.

## How?
```
verb
	,adjective noun1 noun2
```

`verb` will be performed on `noun1`, which will be given `adjective`, and `noun2`, which will have no adjective.
